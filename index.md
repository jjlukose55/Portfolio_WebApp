# 👋 Welcome to My Portfolio

This site is self-hosted using [Smallweb](https://github.com/pomdtr/smallweb), a lightweight HTTP server designed for simplicity and static file serving. My goal is to present my work in a way that is minimal, fast, and fully under my control.

## 🗂️ Project Portfolio

You can view my complete project portfolio in two formats:

- **📄 Markdown Format**:  
  A clean, text-based portfolio written in Markdown.  
  🔗 [portfolio.web.jjluk.net/markdown](https://portfolio.web.jjluk.net/markdown)

- **🖥️ Web App Interface**:  
  A styled, interactive version of my portfolio using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.  
  🔗 [portfolio.web.jjluk.net/webapp](https://portfolio.web.jjluk.net/webapp)

## 🔧 Hosting Details

This portfolio is served directly from my self-managed infrastructure using Smallweb on my homeserver. No third-party hosting, no tracking—just static files and clean presentation.

Thanks for stopping by!
